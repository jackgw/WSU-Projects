# CptS 460: Operating Systems and Computer Architecture

The goal of this project was to implement out own code for the booting, initialization, login, and command execution of a basic command-line operating system. The implemented commands (cat, cp, grep, init, l2u, ls, more) mimic linux functionality, and are compatiable with pipes and redirects as in linux.

The files were compiled and run through a ARM virtual machine.
